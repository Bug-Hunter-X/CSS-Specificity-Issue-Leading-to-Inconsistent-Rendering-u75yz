The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers because of a selector specificity issue:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

The `div p` selector is more specific than the `p` selector, so it will override the `color: red` declaration. However, some browsers might handle specificity differently, leading to inconsistent results.
