To resolve this issue and ensure consistent rendering across browsers, use more explicit selectors or adjust the CSS structure. For example:

```css
div {
  p {
    color: blue; /* More explicit selector, avoids ambiguity */
  }
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

Alternatively, if you intend for the paragraphs within divs to always be blue, simply remove the more general `p` rule and leave only the `div p` rule. 

This ensures that the styling is consistent and predictable, regardless of the browser used.
